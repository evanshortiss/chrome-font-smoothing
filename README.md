## Chrome Font Smoothing Plugin

This is the source code for my Google Chrome "Font Smoothing" Plugin. You can
install the plugin by visting the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/font-smoothing/pblodagimcngmkbdjcaphmjbjlnhicnj)

This plugin is pretty simple. It applies the CSS `-webkit-font-smoothing`
property with the value `antialiased` to all pages you visit.

If you aren't happy with the appearance you can use the plugin menu to set the
smoothing property back to the regular settings, or disable it entirely.

The plugin will remember your smoothing preference for each domain you visit so
you only need to adjust it once.
